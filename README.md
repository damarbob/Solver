# DSM Solver
The DSM Solver project is an open-source Android library developed in Java that aims to assist developers in solving complex problems related to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). With this library, developers can easily implement CVRP solutions in their Android applications. The DSM Solver provides a variety of features, including the ability to utilize the nearest neighbor algorithm for route optimization. Additionally, the library offers a convenient method for saving and accessing distance matrices, allowing developers to efficiently store and retrieve important data for their CVRP solutions. With the DSM Solver, developers can streamline the implementation of CVRP algorithms and enhance the efficiency of their routing solutions.
